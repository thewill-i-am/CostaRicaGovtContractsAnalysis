This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook project written in Python that analyzes public procurement data of the Costa Rican government from 2017 to 2020. The project was originally created for a hackathon competition and provides insights into the government's procurement process. The codebase includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and data visualization techniques, and is designed to be easily understandable and replicable. The project uses Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to perform the analysis. This repository is intended to serve as a reference point for anyone interested in analyzing government procurement data, and also as a proof of concept for building data analytics projects in Jupyter Notebook.
